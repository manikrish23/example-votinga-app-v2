#kubectl taint nodes node01 key=tvalue:NoSchedule -> this needs to run at the node

#taint has to be part of the node and to place restriction on nodes - values to be added in pod definition under containers

apiVersion: v1
kind : pod
metadata:
  name: nginx001
  lables:
    app: nginx01
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-001
      image: nginx
  tolerations:
    - key: "key"
      operator: "Equals"
      value: "tvalue"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
      #tolerationSeconds: 3600 - then the pod will stay bound to the node for 3600 seconds, and then be evicted
